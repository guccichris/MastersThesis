- First, clean up code for efficiency
- Look at plots in R^3 to see how the atoms behave for very long chains
  (watch the chain actually move)
    - Use a for loop to create new plots for each position of the floaters,
      probably will have to add a pause between each new plot so it doesn't
      move too quickly
    - Play with different parameters to see how the simulation changes
